# `FBDeviceControl`

A sister-framework to [`FBSimulatorControl`](https://github.com/facebook/idb/tree/master/FBSimulatorControl) for iOS Devices.

You can use `FBDeviceControl` as a Framework directly, but you may want to look at using `idb` (which uses `FBDeviceControl`) as it provides saner defaults for many scenarios.
