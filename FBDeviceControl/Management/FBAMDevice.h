/**
 An Object Wrapper for AMDevice.
 AMDevice is a Core Foundation Type in the MobileDevice.framework.
 Some important things that we've learned about AMDevice from experimentation and looking at other open source projects:
 - AMDevice sessions should be short-lived. They will timeout after 60 seconds causing subsequent usages (e.g. starting house_arrest service) to fail with:
   0xe800002d (Could not send a message to the device.)
 - The AMDevice session only needs to be open long enough to initiate the operation that requires the AMDevice object. It can be closed immediately after
   without waiting for the subsequent operation to finish. E.g. the right sequence of operations for using a service like com.apple.syslog_relay is:
     AMDeviceConnect
     AMDeviceStartSession
     AMDeviceSecureStartService(amdevice, "com.apple.syslog_relay")
     AMDeviceStopSession
     AMDeviceDisconnect
     // Do stuff with syslog service
     AMDServiceConnectionInvalidate
    Previously we were keeping the AMDevice session open for the duration of the service operation, which could hit the 60 second timeout for long operations,
    causing the next operation to use the AMDevice session to fail.
 - Only one AMDevice session should be open at once. Trying to open another will result in an error that the session is already active. To handle this we
   let concurrent operations share the AMDevice session and only close it when there are no waiting consumers.
   - Interestingly, trying to open a session a third time succeeds, so it seems the second attempt might kill off the first session
 - Starting / stopping the same service on the phone (e.g. house_arrest) many times in a short period will cause the error 0xe800005b (Too many instances of this service are already running.)
   Because of this, we pool service connections with a short cooldown to avoid reopening the same service repeatedly during bursts of operations using that service (e.g. recursively enumerating a directory)
